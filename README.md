# Salveta.rs contest web scraper

**Problem:** There was a contest for a napkin design and there were a lot of entries, but no scoreboard. I wanted to see if I can make my own scoreboard and "predict" the winner.

**Solution:** Created a web scraper with Python and Beautiful Soup which gets the votes for every single entry and sorts them into a text file. I didn't use JSON because I wanted to play with text files and learn to manipulate with them. Let's just say that my predictions were correct!
